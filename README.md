# 2. Expense tracker

For my second portfolio project I decided to design and create an expense-tracking app with vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS. I intended to practice my knowledge about CSS animations, DOM manipulation and regular expressions.

## How to use
- To add an expense click `Add transaction`. Insert a name, description, amount, payment method, category and date, and then hit `Save`. 
- In the case there aren't any categories to choose from, create your own by directly writing into the category field and saving the expense. 
- As soon as you save an expense, the total amount of expenses will be updated.  
- You can check expense statistics by hitting `See statistics`, which will show the 4 categories you've spent the most money on. 
- Edit an expense by hovering over it and hitting the button with a hamburger menu.
- Delete an expense by hovering over it and hitting the button with an `x`.
